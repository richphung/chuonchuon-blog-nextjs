# 5 Quick SEO Tips for Better Blog Rankings

Want more people to find your blog? These simple SEO tweaks can make a big difference in your search rankings.

## 1. Use Keywords in Your Headlines

Include your target keyword in your H1 headline. This tells search engines what your content is about.

**Good:** "How to Start a Successful E-commerce Business"
**Bad:** "Everything You Need to Know About Online Selling"

## 2. Write Meta Descriptions

Craft compelling meta descriptions (150-160 characters) that include your keyword and encourage clicks.

Example: "Learn the essential steps to launch your e-commerce store successfully. Get expert tips on product selection, platform choice, and marketing strategies."

## 3. Add Alt Text to Images

Describe your images with alt text that includes relevant keywords. This helps with accessibility and SEO.

**Good:** "woman writing blog post on laptop"
**Bad:** "image1.jpg"

## 4. Use Internal Links

Link to other relevant posts on your blog. This keeps readers engaged and helps search engines understand your content structure.

## 5. Optimize for Featured Snippets

Answer common questions in a clear, structured format. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and direct answers to increase your chances of appearing in featured snippets.

## Quick Action Items

- Audit your existing headlines for keyword placement
- Write meta descriptions for your top 10 posts
- Add alt text to all images
- Create 3-5 internal links per post
- Include FAQ sections in relevant posts

These small changes can have a big impact on your search visibility. Start with one tip and gradually implement the others for maximum effect.
