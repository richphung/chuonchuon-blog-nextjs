# Translation Keys Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Missing translation keys causing MISSING_MESSAGE errors

---

## 🐛 Issues Found

### Primary Error
```
Error: MISSING_MESSAGE: Could not resolve `blog.readMore` in messages for locale `vi`.
```

### Root Cause
The `messages/vi.json` file was missing several translation keys that existed in `messages/en.json`, causing errors when the Vietnamese locale tried to access those keys.

## 📋 Files Modified

1. **`messages/vi.json`**
   - Added 16 missing translation keys
   - Ensured structure matches `messages/en.json`
   - All keys now have Vietnamese translations

---

## 🔍 How to Prevent This Issue

### Best Practice: Key Parity Check
Always ensure ALL keys in `messages/en.json` exist in `messages/vi.json` (and any other language files).

### Quick Validation Script
```bash
# Compare keys between en and vi
diff <(jq -r 'keys[]' messages/en.json | sort) <(jq -r 'keys[]' messages/vi.json | sort)
```

### When Adding New Translation Keys
1. Add the key to `messages/en.json` first
2. Immediately add the same key to `messages/vi.json`
3. Use English as placeholder if translation not ready yet
4. Test both locales before committing

---
